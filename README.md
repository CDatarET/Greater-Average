# Greater-Average
CodeChef Difficulty 500 Problem

Greater Average
You are given T test cases.
Each test case consists of 3 integers: A, B, and C.

Determine whether the average of A and B is strictly greater than C.

Note:
The average of A and B is defined as:
(A + B) / 2
For example:

The average of 5 and 9 is 7

The average of 5 and 8 is 6.5

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain three integers A, B, and C separated by spaces.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if the average of A and B is strictly greater than **C, otherwise print NO`.

You may print each character of the answer in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yes, yEs will all be considered correct).
